      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 11, 2017 <br> Some similarities between scratch and python are the commands. The difference is that scratch is user friendly, and python is more difficult. :) I enjoyed debugging my program today because as frusterating as it is to debug, it's even more frusterating to realize it was a space or a typo. Which I enjoy finding as strange as that sounds. </p> 
      <p style="text align:center;"> July 17, 2017 <br> My idea of robots haven't change much, i think robots and AI are extremely helpful and super cool, as nerdy as that sounds. I'm excited for the future of robotics because robots are used to make everyday lives easier and it will create more opportunities for computer science jobs and eliminate manufacturing jobs. So far the circuts haven't been that successful because I kinda understand the concepts but my group that I am working with make it extremely difficult because of a lack of effort and the lack of confindence to take on a challenging task such as this.  </body>
