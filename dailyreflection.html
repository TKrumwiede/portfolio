      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 11, 2017 <br> Some similarities between scratch and python are the commands. The difference is that scratch is user friendly, and python is more difficult. :) I enjoyed debugging my program today because as frusterating as it is to debug, it's even more frusterating to realize it was a space or a typo. Which I enjoy finding as strange as that sounds. </p> 
      <p style="text align:center;"> July 17, 2017 <br> My idea of robots haven't change much, i think robots and AI are extremely helpful and super cool, as nerdy as that sounds. I'm excited for the future of robotics because robots are used to make everyday lives easier and it will create more opportunities for computer science jobs and eliminate manufacturing jobs. So far the circuts haven't been that successful because I kinda understand the concepts but my group that I am working with make it extremely difficult because of a lack of effort and the lack of confindence to take on a challenging task such as this.  </body> 
      <p style="text align:center;"> July 20, 2017 <br> Today we coded our robot to get out of a three sided box. It was really interesing because we used whisker wires, which I enjoy the name because I LOVE CATS. But TBH i thought it should of been named a peacock key which lifts wires in the circuit and it looks like a peacock. (Now I am rambling). But my day was great and I met both of my mentors. </p>
      <p style="text align:center;"> July 24, 2017 <br> What I learned about the internet was that when a message is sent, it is broken up into different parts and is sent to the recipient (which I think is really cool because most people including myself before this would think the message would be sent all together). LaTeX in my opinion is a programming language because it allows you to add the feature creep on the math and cs texts, but regardless it formatting a document, it is still a programming language versus a markup. </p>
