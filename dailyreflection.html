      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 7, 2017 <br> Melissa helped me build a game today on scratch and without her it would be extremely difficult. </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 10, 2017 <br> I would make my website accessible to others by having an audio clip (screen readers) or refreshable braille displays. I liked how some centered the writing and added pictures. I am proud of learning html, had no experience and I created a page. </p> 
      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 11, 2017 <br> Some similarities between scratch and python are the commands. The difference is that scratch is user friendly, and python is more difficult. :) I enjoyed debugging my program today because as frusterating as it is to debug, it's even more frusterating to realize it was a space or a typo. Which I enjoy finding as strange as that sounds. </p> 
      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 17, 2017 <br> I'm still very confused about circuts, but I know that it will change this week. But what I did learn about the resistors was the colors around them represent a color.  </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 18, 2017 <br> I learned that while coding circuts. You'll get power to the pin which 
      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 19, 2017 <br> My idea of robots haven't change much, i think robots and AI are extremely helpful and super cool, as nerdy as that sounds. I'm excited for the future of robotics because robots are used to make everyday lives easier and it will create more opportunities for computer science jobs and eliminate manufacturing jobs. So far the circuts haven't been that successful because I kinda understand the concepts but my group that I am working with make it extremely difficult because of a lack of effort and the lack of confindence to take on a challenging task such as this.  </body> 
      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 20, 2017 <br> Today we coded our robot to get out of a three sided box. It was really interesing because we used whisker wires, which I enjoy the name because I LOVE CATS. But TBH i thought it should of been named a peacock key which lifts wires in the circuit and it looks like a peacock. (Now I am rambling). But my day was great and I met both of my mentors. </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 24, 2017 <br> What I learned about the internet was that when a message is sent, it is broken up into different parts and is sent to the recipient (which I think is really cool because most people including myself before this would think the message would be sent all together). LaTeX in my opinion is a programming language because it allows you to add the feature creep on the math and cs texts, but regardless it formatting a document, it is still a programming language versus a markup. </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 28, 2017 <br> Computers are good at data because they have many different ways (data structures) to stores info. You would use a dictionary to store a word and a value, list are to store just words. Dictionaries are larger than list and can store more and not in order. </p> 
      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 31, 2017 <br> What I am really proud of figuring out today was learning about algorithms and understanding them. Also doing long division in my head was an accomplishment. I really enjoyed learning and researching about the page rank algorithm because nobody really knows how to/how a search engine(s) decide which page is on the top. </p> 
      <p style="text-align:center;"> August 1, 2017 <br> The limitations of my social network from yesterday was just being able to create user accounts, and somewhat network. Other features we can add is messaging between users to make them "social" for the social network. </p>  
      <p style="text-align:center;"> August 3, 2017 <br> I am proud of figuring out how to enter in a username in my social network program. Also figuring out what the code means line by line was an accomplishment. I am excited about the final project because I am excited for the outcome. </p>
