      <p style="text-align:center;"> July 11, 2017 <br> Some similarities between scratch and python are the commands. The difference is that scratch is user friendly, and python is more difficult. :) I enjoyed debugging my program today because as frusterating as it is to debug, it's even more frusterating to realize it was a space or a typo. Which I enjoy finding as strange as that sounds. </p>
